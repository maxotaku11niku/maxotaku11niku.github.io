						<h1>Emulating Analogue Video</h1>
						<!--HINTEND:posttitle-->
					</div>
					<img src="assets/analogue_saccharinemagic.jpg" class="bigImage" title="Emulating Analogue Video"/>
					<p>In the distant past, everything was analogue. That meant instead of representing stuff as a sequence of 1s and 0s, it was represented in a more direct way. Images were recorded directly on film, sounds were recorded as grooves on large disks, and videos were recorded on long reels of film. The next step was to move from the mechanical and chemical methods to the magnetic and electric methods, thus giving us radio and TV, music tapes and video tapes. And then that lead to the digital methods of today. I will be talking about <span class="italic">magnetic and electronic</span> analogue video since I wrote two pieces of software that emulate that, not film. These two pieces of software, <a href="https://github.com/maxotaku11niku/AnalogueConvertEffect">AnalogueConvertEffect</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maxotaku11niku/VideoAnalogiser">VideoAnalogiser</a>, share the same basic principle of directly simulating the signals. But in order to make them, I needed to know how analogue video worked<span class="note">[1]<span>Even if I was more approximate, because otherwise my results wouldn't look right.</span></span>, so what follows is a lengthy write-up about the intricaces of analogue TV and VHS and whatnot. Lettuce begin.</p>

						<p>Highly simplified drawing of the process of TV broadcasting</p>
					</div>
					<p>'Television' pretty much literally means 'vision from afar'. It is the culmination of several enabling technologies, and the basis of quite a few others. In order for a practical TV system to have become possible, the following things had to be invented:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A way to record moving images and make them an electric signal.</li>
						<li>A way to send those signals a long way.</li>
						<li>A way to display those signals as a moving image.</li>
					</ul>

						<h1>Basic Video On PC-9801</h1>
						<!--HINTEND:posttitle-->
					</div>
					<img src="assets/pc98video_mockup.png" class="bigImage" title="Basic Video On PC-9801">
					<p>So I've been doing a little thing. Nothing fancy at all. Just a bit of video stuff on computers. No biggie. Well, it wouldn't be anything to write home about unless I had either:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Made a codec that's better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AV1</a> or something.</li>
						<li>Made decent video work on an outdated as hell system.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As you can tell from the post title, I did the latter. I made a video codec with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-98">NEC PC-9801</a> in mind and a video player to play those videos, which was not an easy task. I should mention that so far I have not tested this on real hardware, but I'm pretty confident that it can work. But what is the PC-98?</p>
					<h2>A Brief Introduction to the PC-98</h2>
					<p>The Wikipedia article I linked has the full details, but if you can't be bothered to follow that link then read this section. You can skip it if you're already familiar with the PC-98.</p>

						<h1>Magical Raceway Now On Github</h1>
						<!--HINTEND:posttitle-->
					</div>
					<img src="assets/MagicalRacewayBanner.png" class="bigImage" title="Magical Raceway Now On Github">
					<p>Tada! My game Magical Raceway is now available to download as a Github release! Version 0.5 as well as every earlier version I archived is available for download. It's a retro style arcade racing game with magical girls I developed solo. Check out the page <a href="MagicalRaceway/index.html">here</a> if you want to learn more about how it is at the moment, and my plans for the game. I will use the rest of this post to talk about its history up until this point.</p>
					<h2>The early days: Before the Raceway became Magical</h2>
					<div class="floatRight">
						<img src="assets/outrungbast1.png" title="outrun? outrun what?" alt="OutRun for the GBA">
						<p><span class="italic">OutRun</span> in <span class="italic">Sega Arcade Gallery</span> for the GBA.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Initially, I only wanted to replicate the sort of graphical effect used in classic arcade racing games like <span class="italic">OutRun</span> and <span class="italic">Hang On</span> because I thought it would be fun. Although, my <span class="italic">actual</span> point of reference was a Game Boy Advance port of some of Sega's classic arcade games made by the infamous THQ. Recreating this in Unity wouldn't be hard, right? I am targeting modern computers with gigahertz multicore processors and even integrated GPUs can render 2D graphics as if it were nothing. So all I have to work out is the maths, and it was some pretty complicated maths that I needed to figure out to get this to work.</p>
					<p>To control the appearance of the road, five parameters need to be varied at runtime: two position coordinates, how much the road bends in both the horizontal and vertical directions and how much split there is between the two road segments. Well, the way to simulate the road width varying without stretching the road texture is to have two segments with an imaginary line marking the boundary between them, so that's what the last parameter controls: the difference in road offset between the two sides. If the road split value gets large enough, the road appears to split into a dual carriageway! Magical Raceway's road functions basically the same as this version of <span class="italic">OutRun</span> does in that respect.</p>

					<p>Hello! My Github Pages site is now active. This will be the place for most of the things I make. Free hosting is such a blessing, but it does come with some limitations, of course. Perhaps sometime in the future, this site may be hosted somewhere else, but for now, here it is.</p>
					<p>This website was built with a text editor and a Python script to build the blog part. It gets the job done, hopefully without taking too long to load. If you're using a mobile, please do check if it displays correctly, because this website may be a bit biased towards desktop/laptop users. Sorry about that.</p>
					<p>Things are still under construction here, so not everything is present at the moment. I'll be updating some stuff in due time once I'm sure of what to do. In the meantime: this is it. Well, maybe there'll be a few interesting blogposts or something. What would I write about in that case? Just stuff that interests me, of course.</p>
